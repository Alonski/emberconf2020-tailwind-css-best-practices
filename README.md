cd emberconf-2020-tailwindcss-best-practices
yarn install
ember s
```

## Intro

Assume already familiar with tailwind. We'll do a quick overview

## Useful VSCode plugins

- Tailwind intellisense
- Headwind

## 1: Basic Tailwind

- Style a blog post
- Pseudo states
- Responsive design

## 2: Extract components, not classes

Padding trick for fixed aspect ratio.

```hbs
<div class="relative bg-red-500 pb-2/3">
  <img
    class="absolute object-cover w-full h-full"
    src="https://source.unsplash.com/_Dogn_h7Qek"
  />
</div>
```

How to think about abstracting + sharing? Might reach for @apply.

Problem is you still have to duplicate html structure. Need a wrapper + child. Other problme is you have to go to css file and break html-first workflow.

Instead, use components.

```hbs
<AspectRatio @ratio='16:9'>
  <img>
</AspectRatio>
```

This is going to be a theme of this training. Components like this keep us in the html. That should be a goal with the abstractions you make: html-first workflow. Keeps you productive.

## 3: Tailwind-friendly Component APIs

`<Link>` takes activeClass arg. Let's make it work.

Our styles are stomping each other. We need to think of an API that's Tailwind-friendly.

What we really want is `<Link class='' @activeClass='' @inactiveClass=''>`. Let's make it work.

## 4: Layout with Flexbox

Old school button group here. Buttons are foated left, parent is inline-block. How to center?

Use text-center.

This is weird - we're using `text-align: center` to lay out a component?

With Tailwind + modern css you'll get very familiar with flexbox. Its great because it works in many more contexts and you usually don't need to worry about whether the child you're laying out is block or inline. The layout is kept more separate from the thing you're laying out. Also floats are super weird. Also the height of our group is different from the buttons â€“ because of line-height. Again, inline elements are kinda weird.

[ **Exercise**: Once you have it using flexbox, copy + paste the button group so there are two. Play with the justify-* classes on the parent. ]

## 5: Exercise: Practice Layout with Flexbox

Match the layout on the right. Notice the behavior if you shrink the viewport. You'll need to look up the "Flex Shrink" utilities on tailwindcss.com.

## 6: More layout - measured text

Try to encapsulate the measured text in a component. Notice how you can lay it out with flexbox.

---

- Rely on the default theme, extend as necessary
  - stick with Tailwind's scales to make your extensions predictable
- Flexbox for layout
  - Use cases
  - Negative margin for gaps
  - Negative margin to remove outer space on list of pills so they can wrap
- Grid for layout
  - Use cases
- Grid + flex layout combo (<List />)
- Styling form inputs with Form plugin
- px() function for fontSize
- New line-height pixel values instead of 1.5
- Writing a plugin to link letter-spacing and text-size
- <Text /> component with built-in measure (max-width). Must use something like flex parent to lay out.
- SVG example (maybe tui toggle)
- Markdown example? postcss-nested
- Max width + grid vs. weird width values (`xxl:w-440` from embermap)
  - The default values are extremely well thought out. Try to embrace them.
- Escape hatches, e.g. css modules
- key-focus polyfill
- When layouts are extremely different at responsive breakpoints, just make a new block and hide with `sm:hidden`. No reason to overcomplicate the HTML just because the content is the same. Duplicating content is way simpler than making one single uber-layout.
  - Also, don't use JS to change layout based on viewport size => not SSR-able. Stick with css media queries.
